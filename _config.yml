about_content: |
  I'm an aspiring SOC Analyst with a strong passion for cybersecurity, threat detection, and blue team operations. I'm actively building labs, studying attack techniques, and gaining hands-on experience with tools like ELK, Wireshark, and Splunk. 

  Currently certified with CompTIA Security+ and Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow in the field of cybersecurity.

          Set up a Windows Server honeypot to simulate brute-force login attempts via RDP. Collected and visualized logs using Winlogbeat and the ELK stack. Used Kibana to create dashboards for detecting suspicious login behavior.
