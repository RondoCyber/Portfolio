  I'm an aspiring SOC Analyst with a strong passion for cybersecurity, threat detection, and blue team operations. I'm actively building labs, studying attack techniques, and gaining hands-on experience with tools like ELK, Wireshark, and Splunk. 

  Currently certified with CompTIA Security+ and Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow in the field of cybersecurity.

        title: "Blue Team Lab: Detecting RDP Brute Force with Winlogbeat and ELK"
        description: |
          **Lab Setup:**  
          Kali Linux (Attacker) – 192.168.20.11  
          Windows 11 Pro (Target) – 192.168.20.10  
          Ubuntu ELK Stack (SIEM) – 192.168.20.12  

          All machines were connected to a virtual internal network. Winlogbeat was installed on the Windows machine to forward logs to Elasticsearch, where they were visualized in Kibana.

          **Tools Used:**  
          - Hydra – to simulate the brute-force RDP attack from Kali  
          - Winlogbeat – to ship Windows logs to ELK  
          - Kibana – for log visualization and event correlation  
          - Elasticsearch + Logstash – for log storage and parsing  

          **Attack Simulation:**  
          Using Kali, a brute-force RDP attack was launched against the Windows 11 machine using Hydra:  
          ```
          hydra -t 4 -V -f -l Administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.20.10
          ```
          This simulated an attacker attempting multiple login combinations via RDP.

          **Detection in ELK:**  
          On the ELK stack (Kibana), Event ID 4625 (failed login attempt) was searched using


      **Concepts**: Threat detection, log analysis, network security, incident response, blue team methodology

      **Soft Skills**: Self-driven, continuous learner, strong attention to detail
